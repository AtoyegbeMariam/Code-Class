        <h1>Early Life</h1>
        <p>
          Wole Soyinka was born Akinwande Oluwole "Wole" Babatunde Soyinka on
          July 13, 1934, in Abeokuta, near Ibadan in western Nigeria. His
          father, Samuel Ayodele Soyinka, was a prominent Anglican minister and
          headmaster. His mother, Grace Eniola Soyinka, who was called "Wild
          Christian," was a shopkeeper and local activist. As a child, he lived
          in an Anglican mission compound, learning the Christian teachings of
          his parents, as well as the Yoruba spiritualism and tribal customs of
          his grandfather. A precocious and inquisitive child, Wole prompted the
          adults in his life to warn one another: “He will kill you with his
          questions.” After finishing preparatory university studies in 1954 at
          Government College in Ibadan, Soyinka moved to England and continued
          his education at the

          >University_of_Leeds</a>
           where he served as the editor of the school's
          magazine, The Eagle. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in English
          literature in 1958. (In 1972 the university awarded him an honorary
          doctorate).

        <h1>Plays & Political Activism</h1>
        <p>
          In the late 1950s Soyinka wrote his first important play, A Dance of
          the Forests, which satirized the Nigerian political elite. From 1958
          to 1959, Soyinka was a dramaturgist at the Royal Court Theatre in
          London. In 1960, he was awarded a Rockefeller fellowship and returned
          to Nigeria to study African drama. In 1960, he founded the theater
          group, The 1960 Masks, and in 1964, the Orisun Theatre Company, in
          which he produced his own plays and performed as an actor. He has
          periodically been a visiting professor at the universities of
          Cambridge, Sheffield, and Yale. Soyinka is also a political activist,
          and during the civil war in Nigeria he appealed in an article for a
          cease-fire. He was arrested for this in 1967, and held as a political
          prisoner for 22 months until 1969.

        <h1>Nobel Prize and Later Career</h1>
        <p>
          In 1986, upon awarding Soyinka with the Nobel Prize for Literature,
          the committee said the playwright "in a wide cultural perspective and
          with poetic overtones fashions the drama of existence." Soyinka
          sometimes writes of modern West Africa in a satirical style, but his
          serious intent and his belief in the evils inherent in the exercise of
          power are usually present in his work. To date, Soyinka has published
          hundreds of works. In addition to drama and poetry, he has written two
          novels, The Interpreters (1965) and Season of Anomy (1973), as well as
          autobiographical works including The Man Died: Prison Notes (1972), a
          gripping account of his prison experience, and Aké ( 1981), a memoir
          about his childhood. Myth, Literature and the African World (1975) is
          a collection of Soyinka's literary essays. “Against my rational
          instincts, I believe that we have here a genuine case of a born-again
          democrat,” he said. Ultimately, “the real heroes of this exercise have
          been the Nigerian people and that gingers me up.” Now considered
          Nigeria's foremost man of letters, Soyinka is still politically active
          and spent the 2015 election day in Africa's biggest democracy working
          the phones to monitor reports of voting irregularities, technical
          issues and violence, according to The Guardian. After the election on
          March 28, 2015, he said that Nigerians must show a
